This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

### High-Level Design Summary: Spreadsheet Application

#### Overview

The Spreadsheet Application is designed to provide users with a user-friendly interface for organizing and manipulating data in a tabular format, commonly referred to as a spreadsheet. The application allows users to perform various operations such as entering data, applying formulas, and performing calculations.

#### Key Components

1. **User Interface (UI):**
   - The UI presents a grid-based layout resembling a traditional spreadsheet.
   - Users can interact with cells to input data, apply formulas, and navigate through the grid.
   - Features include selection of cells, editing of cell contents, and formula bar for entering formulas.

2. **Data Management:**
   - The application manages data in a two-dimensional array structure representing the spreadsheet grid.
   - Each cell in the grid is represented by an object containing metadata such as value, formula, and dependencies.

3. **Formula Parsing and Calculation:**
   - The application supports basic spreadsheet formulas using a formula parser.
   - Formulas are parsed to identify cell references and dependencies.
   - Formula calculations are performed dynamically based on cell dependencies and updates.

4. **Event Handling and State Management:**
   - Event handling mechanisms capture user interactions such as cell selection, input changes, and formula execution.
   - State management ensures that changes to the grid data trigger appropriate updates and recalculations.

5. **Grid Manager:**
   - The Grid Manager module encapsulates grid-related operations and manages cell updates.
   - It provides functions for adding, updating, and querying cell data within the grid.

#### Architecture Overview

- **Frontend (Client-Side):**
  - The frontend is implemented using a modern JavaScript framework (e.g., React) for building interactive UI components.
  - Components are structured to handle user inputs, display grid data, and facilitate data flow between UI and backend services.

- **Backend (Server-Side):**
  - The backend may include services for data persistence, authentication, and computation (e.g., formula evaluation).
  - Data is stored and managed using a database system (e.g., SQL or NoSQL database) to enable scalability and data integrity.

#### Interaction Flow

1. **User Interaction:**
   - Users interact with the application by selecting cells, entering data, and applying formulas via the UI.
   - Input events trigger data updates and formula evaluations.

2. **Data Processing:**
   - Input data undergoes validation and parsing to determine if it is a value or a formula.
   - Formulas are evaluated by the formula parser to compute cell values based on dependencies.

3. **State Management:**
   - Changes in the grid state are managed using state management techniques (e.g., React state or Redux).
   - State updates trigger re-renders of relevant UI components to reflect changes in the spreadsheet.

#### Conclusion

The Spreadsheet Application employs a modular and scalable architecture to enable efficient data management, formula processing, and user interaction. By leveraging frontend and backend technologies, the application delivers a robust and intuitive user experience for spreadsheet manipulation.
